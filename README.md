🚀 Just built something simple, fun, and powerful — a Virtual Guestbook using Node.js, Express, and EJS!

💡 The idea: allow users to submit their name and a message, and instantly see their entry added to a live guestbook — just like signing a physical one, but on the web.

💻 What I learned: <br>
✅ Setting up a basic Node.js server </br><br> 
✅ Handling form submissions using POST requests </br> <br>
✅ Using EJS templates to render dynamic content </br> <br>
